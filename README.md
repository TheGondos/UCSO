# Universal Cargo System for Orbiter
Universal Cargo System for Orbiter (UCSO) is a cargo management system for Orbiter 2016, designed to replace UCGO.
New cargoes can be added without any programming via configuration files.
It provides an API for vessel authors to add UCSO support to their vessels.

Read the manual for instructions.

[ShuttlePB UCSO](https://github.com/abdullah-radwan/ShuttlePB_UCSO) is required to run the scenarios. Make sure to match UCSO and ShuttlePB build version.

## Current Version: Alpha 5.

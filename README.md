# Universal Cargo System for Orbiter
Universal Cargo System for Orbiter (UCSO) is a free, open-source cargo management system for the Orbiter space simulator. 
It’s designed to be an Orbiter 2016 alternative of UCGO. It provides a rich API for add-on developers to support UCSO in their creations.

## Build
Clone the repository into Orbitersdk folder to have the paths set correctly. 
[Dynamic XRSound](https://www.orbithangar.com/showAddon.php?id=5376bb58-c52b-4708-a4eb-cdcb7eb1dc55) is required to enable the sound for the cargoes platform.
